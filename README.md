# üìä Tableau Financial Analysis Dashboard

## üìù Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard developed to analyze financial performance metrics across various market segments, products, and countries. The analysis provides actionable insights into sales, profits, and costs using transactional data from a multinational organization.

## üìÅ Data Source

The dataset was sourced from an Excel file (`Financials.csv.xlsx`) containing detailed financial records, including:

- Sales figures
- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
- Profit margins
- Discounts
- Units sold
- Time-based fields (Date, Month, Year)
- Categorical fields (Country, Segment, Product)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation

Before visualization in Tableau, the dataset was cleaned and preprocessed:

- Converted currency fields (e.g., Sales, Profit) to numeric format
- Standardized product and country names
- Created derived time dimensions (Month Name, Year)
- Removed nulls and irrelevant data entries
